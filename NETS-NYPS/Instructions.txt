Data-Driven Power System Linear Model Identification via Quadrature-Based Balanced Truncation
Author: PhD. Candidate José Alberto Moreno Corbea

Thanks for using our development. We provide the implementación to identify de Power System Linear Model  via Quadrature-Based Balance Truncation Approach by using the Power System Toolbox (PST) simulation software for Matlab.

Instructions:
1. Unzip the file "Power_System_Identification_QBBT.rar".
2. Open the folder "Power_System_Identification_QBBT" and add it to the Matlab path. 
3. Open and execute, maintaining the indicated order, the files:
- "File1_Quatrature_BCC.m"
- "File2_quadrature_sorting.m"
- "File3_freq_extract.m"
- "File4_QBBT.m"
4. After executing "File4_QBBT.m", the matrices of the identified model will be saved in the "QBBT_model.mat" file.
