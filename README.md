Thanks for using our development. We provide the implementation to identify Power System Linear Models via Quadrature-Based Balanced Truncation Approach by using the Power System Toolbox (PST) simulation software for Matlab.

Instructions:

To select the case study and open the folder corresponding to the system: "KRK power system" or "NETS-NYPS".
To add the selected folder to the Matlab path.
To open and execute, maintaining the indicated order, the files:
"File1_Quatrature_BCC.m"
"File2_quadrature_sorting.m"
"File3_freq_extract.m"
"File4_QBBT.m"

After executing "File4_QBBT.m", the matrices of the identified model will be saved in the "QBBT_model.mat" file.
